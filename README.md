Encouraging Vaccination Compliance: A Model to Target Non-Vaccinators
A model to predict whether an individual will not take the seasonal flu vaccine would be useful in designing and targeting public health campaigns to encourage future vaccination against seasonal flu and other communicable diseasesâ€”notably the present global COVID-19 pandemic. Four classification models were explored: decision tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes-Bernoulli, and logistic regression. 
Data source: Data from the CDC National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS): a list-assisted random-digit dialing telephone survey conducted in the 2009-10 flu season.
